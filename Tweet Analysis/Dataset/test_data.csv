Let us ask for the strength to know how to live in humble and confident silence that awaits the Lord's salvation, without complaining and without grumbling.",
INTP,"I usually read a lot of non-fiction books, but lately I’ve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would’ve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year: do you like better?|||There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. read a lot of great books this year.

This #WorldToiletDay, I’m optimistic this sanitation crisis can be solved. saw incredible innovation in health and climate. I am excited about many of these advancements and look forward to seeing what’s next. love the message in @JohnDoerr’s new book that in order to eliminate the Green Premiums, we need to make a scalable plan now: bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is an important step on America’s path to achieving net-zero emissions. But the job is not done. Congress should also pass the Build Back Better Act to help accelerate development of the climate solutions we need. sharing and global collaboration move us closer to new #Alzheimers diagnostics, treatments, and cures. I’m optimistic about what lies ahead: still have a lot of work to do, but the conversation I heard at the #COP26 climate summit left me feeling optimistic that we can avoid a climate disaster: on student outcomes can help institutional leaders and policymakers better understand the economic value that colleges deliver to students.
